    abstract: `
During the labs, I have been designing an instrumentation shield for Arduino Uno, which goal is to process the values measured by a gas sensor (that we made earlier), 
display them (with a LCD screen) and send them via Bluetooth. This entry contains the schematic and layout realized, and a link to the source.

    /* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Conclusion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */
    conclusion: `
It is the first time I had to deal with designing a shield.  Thanks to this lab, I learned how to use a PCB design software, Eagle, to create and use my components in 
order to create a full board. I had to face routing problems, integrate specific contraints related to the fabrication process 
(pads size, angles of the route intersections, and so on).
It was a completely new experience for me, having a more software-oriented background. I cannot honnestly say that I master the design process perfectly, but at least
I got introduced to it, and I am now more aware of some problems that PCB designers face.
