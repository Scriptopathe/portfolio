# Project and time management
This project had very tight time constraints. I had two weeks to build this game, 
but at the time I was in an intership in Viveris Technologies. Therefore, I could
only work on this project after my workday. 
I had to get feedback from my client in very short cycles (2-3 days), in order to 
make the product they really wanted. This is mostly because the specifications given
by the client were ambiguous, and a lot of visual aspects were not in the specs. 
In the end, the client was happy with the product !

# Mobile development
This project increased my skills in multi-platform mobile development. I had to think
about how to test, build, and deploy my application, struggle with bugs that only appeared
on specific phone models, and so on.
