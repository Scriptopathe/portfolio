    /* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Abstract ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */
    abstract: `
At the end of my third year at INSA, I wanted to get an intership in a 
research laboratory. The main goal of this internship was to look at how
people worked in the research field, though my intership subject was
a simple technical one : building a web interface for a real-time
scheduling simulation tool.`,

    /* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Conclusion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */
    conclusion: `
Thanks to this internship, I got a glimpse at how people worked in a research lab.
I really enjoyed the environment, and the people I met there taught me a lot about
how they worked. 

I also improved my skills in web development, through the development of the Simso web
tool (http://projects.laas.fr/simso/simso-web/#/configuration), and an experiment 
platform used by the researchers to share their data sets and
results, in order to be able to reproduce experiment made by other researchers.
